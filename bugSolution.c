/* Additional notes: 
   - The code is improved to avoid potential memory issues or undefined behavior. 
   - Proper input validation and checks are implemented (in more complex scenarios, this would be crucial).
   - Memory allocation and deallocation are carefully handled (again, important in more involved examples).  */
